## Overview

**Firefly Framework Domain Starter** is an opinionated Spring Boot starter for building domain-layer microservices following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This starter brings together the essential capabilities needed for implementing business logic in a reactive, event-driven architecture.

Unlike a traditional library, this **starter** is designed to bootstrap domain-tier microservices with pre-configured integrations for:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Aggregate roots, value objects, domain events, and repository patterns
- **CQRS**: Command/query separation with handler auto-discovery and execution context propagation
- **SAGA Orchestration**: Distributed transactions via the transactional engine with step event publishing
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reactive domain event publishing through Kafka, RabbitMQ, or other adapters
- **Service Communication**: Resilient inter-service communication with circuit breakers and retries

This starter automatically wires up JSON structured logging, step event bridges for SAGA integration, and observability infrastructure. It serves as the architectural foundation for domain microservices that implement core business logic while participating in distributed workflows and event streams.

**When to use this starter**: Building domain-layer microservices that encapsulate business rules, coordinate distributed transactions, and emit domain events to drive downstream processing.

## Features

- **DDD Building Blocks**: Domain entities, aggregates, value objects, and repository abstractions
- **CQRS Integration**: Automatic command/query bus wiring with fireflyframework-cqrs
- **SAGA Support**: Step event publisher bridge for distributed transaction orchestration
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Seamless integration with fireflyframework-eda for domain event publishing
- **Service Client Framework**: Reactive inter-service communication with resilience patterns
- **Observability**: JSON structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing auto-configuration
- **Reactive-First**: Built on Project Reactor for non-blocking I/O and backpressure handling
- **Clean Architecture**: Enforces separation between domain logic and infrastructure concerns

## Requirements

- Java 21+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven 3.9+

## Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.fireflyframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>fireflyframework-starter-domain</artifactId>
    <version>26.02.06</version>
</dependency>
```

This starter transitively includes:
- `fireflyframework-cqrs` for command/query handling
- `fireflyframework-eda` for event publishing
- `fireflyframework-client` for service communication
- `lib-transactional-engine` integration for SAGA orchestration
- `fireflyframework-observability` for metrics and tracing

## Quick Start

```java
@Service
public class AccountDomainService {

    private final StepEventPublisherBridge stepEvents;

    public AccountDomainService(StepEventPublisherBridge stepEvents) {
        this.stepEvents = stepEvents;
    }

    public Mono<Account> createAccount(CreateAccountRequest request) {
        return validateRequest(request)
            .flatMap(this::persistAccount)
            .flatMap(account -> stepEvents.publish("account-created", account)
                .thenReturn(account));
    }
}
```

## Configuration

```yaml
firefly:
  domain:
    json-logging:
      enabled: true
    step-events:
      enabled: true
```
